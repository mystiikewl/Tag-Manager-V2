# Active Context

## Current Development Status

### JavaScript Code Organization

- Reverted to the original working implementation in index.html (previously index backup.html)
- Archived the refactored version as index_archive.html for future reference
- Current implementation has all JavaScript code within the HTML file
- Previous attempt at modularizing the JavaScript code has been put on hold

### Active Issues

- JavaScript refactoring attempt encountered issues with category hierarchy display
- Decision made to revert to working version to maintain functionality
- Future task: Revisit JavaScript modularization with improved architecture

### Current Focus

- Maintaining stable functionality with the original implementation
- Documenting the attempted refactoring for future reference
- Planning a more robust approach to JavaScript modularization

### Recent Changes

- Renamed original index.html to index_archive.html
- Restored backup version (with working JS) as the new index.html
- Preserved the modularized JavaScript files for future reference
- Updated project structure to reflect these changes

### Next Steps

1. Document lessons learned from the refactoring attempt
2. Plan a new approach to JavaScript modularization
3. Consider implementing changes incrementally rather than all at once
4. Review and update test cases for the current implementation
