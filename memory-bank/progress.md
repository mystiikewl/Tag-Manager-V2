# Project Progress

## Current Status

### Completed Features

1. Product selection and display
2. Category management system
   - Three-level category hierarchy
   - Category creation
   - Category assignment to products
   - Category removal
3. CSV export functionality
4. Last modified tracking
5. Basic error handling and user feedback

### Recent Changes

- Reverted JavaScript refactoring attempt
- Restored working implementation from backup
- Archived refactored version for future reference
- Updated file structure:
  - index.html (current working version)
  - index_archive.html (archived refactored version)

### Known Issues

1. JavaScript Modularization
   - Attempted refactoring encountered issues with category hierarchy
   - Currently using single-file implementation
   - Need to plan better approach for future modularization

### Pending Tasks

1. JavaScript Refactoring (On Hold)

   - Review lessons learned from first attempt
   - Plan new modularization strategy
   - Consider incremental approach
   - Improve test coverage before next attempt

2. Immediate Tasks

   - Document current implementation thoroughly
   - Add inline comments to clarify complex logic
   - Create test cases for current functionality
   - Review error handling and user feedback

3. Future Improvements
   - Implement proper JavaScript module system
   - Add unit tests for JavaScript functions
   - Improve error handling and recovery
   - Consider adding automated testing

## Technical Debt

1. JavaScript Organization

   - All code currently in single HTML file
   - Limited separation of concerns
   - Need for better modularity
   - Lack of proper testing infrastructure

2. Documentation
   - Need better documentation of JavaScript functions
   - Require architectural documentation
   - Missing test documentation

## Next Sprint Goals

1. Document current implementation
2. Add comprehensive comments to JavaScript code
3. Create test plan for future refactoring
4. Review and update error handling
5. Plan incremental approach to modularization

## Long-term Goals

1. Complete JavaScript modularization
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Improve code maintainability
4. Enhance user experience
5. Add new features (TBD)

## What Works

- Category display system with color-coded hierarchy:
  - Level 1 categories displayed in blue
  - Level 2 categories displayed in red
  - Level 3 categories displayed in green
  - Interactive hover effects and smooth transitions
- The CSV export feature for product categories has been successfully implemented
- Products are now listed with their allocated categories in the CSV output
- Products without categories are indicated as "No Categories"
- Database rebuild functionality is now working:
  - products.db contains detailed product information
  - products-MSI.db contains category relationships
  - Both databases are successfully populated from input_file.csv

## What's Left to Build

- Monitor the CSV export feature for any issues
- Gather user feedback on the new category styling system
- Consider adding validation for database imports
- Consider adding visual indicators for category levels in the UI

## Current Status

- Category styling system is implemented and functioning:
  - Color-coded categories based on hierarchy level
  - Interactive hover effects
  - Smooth transitions
- The backend endpoint for CSV export is complete and functioning as expected
- Frontend integration for CSV export functionality has been developed
- Database rebuild scripts are operational:
  - clear_products_db.py
  - initialize_products_db.py
  - insert_products.py
  - rebuild_products_db.py

## Known Issues

- Categories are not displaying correctly after the JavaScript migration.
- Level 2 and level 3 categories are not being displayed based on the selection of level 1 categories.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Implemented color-coded category display system to improve visual hierarchy and user experience
- The decision to include all products in the CSV output, even those without categories, was made to enhance usability and clarity for users
- Added default 'deny' value for variant_inventory_policy during database rebuild

## Next Steps

- Investigate and fix the JavaScript logic to ensure hierarchical category display works as intended.
- Test the application to confirm the fix resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
