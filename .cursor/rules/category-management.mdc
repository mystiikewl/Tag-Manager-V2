# Category Management

## Category Hierarchy

### Structure
- Three-level hierarchical system:
  1. Level 1: Top-level categories
  2. Level 2: Sub-categories (must have Level 1 parent)
  3. Level 3: Detailed categories (must have Level 2 parent)

### Rules
- Each category must have a unique name within its level and parent
- Level 1 categories have no parent
- Level 2 categories must have a Level 1 parent
- Level 3 categories must have a Level 2 parent
- Categories can have multiple children
- A category can only have one parent

## Category Operations

### Creation

- Level must be specified (1, 2, or 3)
- Parent ID required for levels 2 and 3
- Validation checks:
  - Name uniqueness
  - Parent existence
  - Level validity
  - Parent level compatibility

### Assignment
- Products can have multiple categories
- Categories can be assigned to multiple products
- Assignment validation:

  - No duplicate assignments

### Removal

- Category removal doesn't delete the category
- Orphaned categories are allowed
